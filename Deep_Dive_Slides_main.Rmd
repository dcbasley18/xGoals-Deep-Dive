## Problems

  - Assessing accuracy of MoneyPuck expected goals model
  
  - How well can shot angle and shot distance predict goals

  - Does the effect distance and angle have on the xGoals model change over time?

---

## Data

  - Using shot data from MoneyPuck
  
  - Variables of interest are shot angle and shot distance

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width= "0.5%", out.height= ".1%" }
data <- shots %>%
    select(season, arenaAdjustedShotDistance, shotAngleAdjusted, goal, xGoal)
#library(knitr)
#library(kableExtra)
#kable(head(data[, 1:8]), caption = "2020 Shots Data")

library(gt)
data %>%
  slice(1:5) %>%
  gt()


```

## Bootstrapping

- Method of re sampling with replacement
- Comparing bootstrap sample coefficient trends to model trends
- Limit uncertainty for coefficient trends over time

---
## Discussion

- Looked at how well calibrated MoneyPuck's xGoals model is for different conditions

- Looked at coefficient trends over the past 10 seasons

- Limitations
--
  -Data involves shortened seasons (i.e 2012-13, 2019-20, 2020-21)


- What's next
--
 - Adding player age and goalie age as predictor variables to our model
